>**Abstract**: _Ultrasound imaging is crucial for evaluating organ morphology and function, yet depth adjustment can degrade image quality and field-of-view, presenting a depth-dependent dilemma. 
Traditional interpolation-based zoom-in techniques often sacrifice detail and introduce artifacts. Motivated by the potential of arbitrary-scale super-resolution to naturally address these 
inherent challenges, we present the Residual Dense Swin Transformer Network (RDSTN), designed to capture the non-local characteristics and long-range dependencies intrinsic to ultrasound images.
It comprises a linear embedding module for feature enhancement, an encoder with shifted-window attention for modeling non-locality, and an MLP decoder for continuous detail reconstruction. 
This strategy streamlines balancing image quality and field-of-view, which offers superior textures over traditional methods. Experimentally, RDSTN outperforms existing approaches while requiring 
fewer parameters. In conclusion, RDSTN shows promising potential for ultrasound image enhancement by overcoming the limitations of conventional interpolation-based methods and achieving depth-independent imaging._

## 1. Background
Ultrasound imaging serves as a pivotal tool in medical diagnostics for its non-invasive nature and real-time imaging capabilities, allowing visualization of superficial and deep structures. However, adjusting the imaging depth presents challenges that impact image quality and field-of-view. Modifying the imaging depth in ultrasound requires altering the echo reception time. Longer reception times, necessary for deeper imaging, tend to lower the frame rate, subsequently reducing temporal resolution. A shallow imaging depth, however, may lead to interference from adjacent echo signals, compromising image quality. Therefore, selecting the appropriate depth threshold is crucial. Traditionally, zoom-in operations utilizing interpolation have been employed to counterbalance unsatisfactory image quality during depth adjustments. This often results in the loss of intricate details and the emergence of aliasing artifacts. Addressing this challenge, our study presents the arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) as a cutting-edge approach that offers an effective solution within the desired depth threshold.
